                        The making of Sophia is described and commented, a new humanoid
                        robot that stands out for having been built with the latest advances in
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) that  allow it, for example, to  learn and gain
                        experience from its interaction with human beings. Also, its appearance
                        and wide repertoire of facial gestures that it has, significantly brings it
                        closer to the human pattern. Its presence has gained notoriety for her
                        presentations in at least a couple of United Nations events and also for
                        having received Saudi citizenship, being the first robot in the world to hold
                        that  status. Sophia's  particular  technological qualities  have  begun to
                        generate  repercussions  of  various  kinds,  not  only  in  the  academic-
                        scientific  world,  but  also  ethically,  artistically,  religiously,  morally,
                        politically and  economically. From the  above,  it can  be affirmed  that
                        Sophia has marked the beginning of a new era, not only robotic but also
                        technological in general, which now allows to see with greater certainty
                        the real emergence of a successor of the human species.
